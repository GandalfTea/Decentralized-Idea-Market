_Indeed, it is becoming ever more obvious that it is not famine, not earthquakes, not microbes, not cancer but man himself who is man's greatest danger to man, for the simple reason that there is no adequate protection against psychic epidemics, which are infinitely more devastating than the worst of natural catastrophes_       
-Carl Jung

_...the totalitarian systems of the 20th century represent a kind of collective psychosis. Weather gradually or suddenly, reason and common human decency are no longer possible in such a system: there is only a pervasive atmosphere of terror, and a projection of "the enemy", imagined to be "in our midst". Thus society turns on itself urged on by the ruling authorities_        
-Joost Meerloo

_Crimes the individual alone could never stand are freely committed by the group_.       
-Carl Jung

An open idea market could serve as a collective sanity check for a group of individuals or nations, showing the real beliefs and desires of the population. If done well, it is almost impossible to influence and introduce propaganda in it, thus serving as a proxy for civil disobedience,  potentially replacing other more violent or endangering means for the individual.
